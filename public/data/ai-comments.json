This means that users who have forgotten their password may encounter issues when trying to reset it. The exact nature of the problem isn't clear from the error message, but it could potentially prevent users from accessing their accounts, which would be a significant issue for user experience.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è *For Developer:* The test failure error message is not very informative - it just shows \"[object Object]\", which suggests that an object was passed when a string was expected. This could be a problem with the test itself or with the code that the test is checking. \n\nFirst, check the Gherkin step that failed. Is it correctly defined? Is it expecting the right kind of output from the function it's testing? \n\nNext, look at the function that this step is testing. Is it returning what it's supposed to? Could it be returning an object when it should be returning a string? \n\nAlso, check the selectors used in this test. Are they correctly identifying the elements they're supposed to? \n\nFinally, look at the timing of the test. Could the test be running before the function it's testing has finished executing? If so, that could cause the test to fail. \n\nIn short, you'll need to debug the test and the code it's testing to figure out why it's failing."
